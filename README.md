# Java Class Hierarchy – „Share surprises”

I designed and implemented a Java application that manages a collection of surprises for the winter holidays.
The application includes a mechanism for collecting surprises prepared by generous people, storing them
in various types of containers, and distributing them to children.

I implemented the application using key concepts of object-oriented programming, such as inheritance,
encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.

Overall, the Java application provides an organized and enjoyable way for people to contribute to
the holiday spirit and bring joy to children.

During the implementation of the application, the following notions were taken into account:
* reusing functionality through various processes, such as:
  - inheritance 
  - composition and aggregation
* hiding functionality and data through encapsulation 
* implementing wrapper methods and using delegation 
* further development of practical design skills and design of a class architecture,
  medium level of complexity 
* proper organization of code according to applicability, classes, methods 
* work with objects of different types from a common perspective using upcasting 
* design and use of interfaces in communication between components 
* familiarization with the concept of genericity in software development
